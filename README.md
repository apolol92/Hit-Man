# Hit-Man
A very simple mp3 player controlled by a pice of paper.  
The goal of this project was to get started with computer vision and OpenCV.  
Before this project I didn't do something with computer vision.  
For me this project is just a warm up.

# Preperation
<ol>
<li>Print radio.pdf</li>
<li>Focus with your webcam the printed radio.pdf</li>
<li>Put music files into the music-folder</li>
<li>Make sure you use the right rgb-colors..</li>
<li>Start the program and enjoy the music..</li>
</ol>

# Optimization
+ Change button touched triggering
+ Automatic button detection without choosing RGB-COlOR
